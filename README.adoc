== jo4neo - Java Objects for Neo4j
=== What does it
jo4neo is a simple Java object mapping for http://neo4.org[Neo4j]. No byte code interweaving, just plain old reflection and plain old objects.

jo4neo has been developed by https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylorcowan/[Taylor Cowan], all credit goes to him. The https://code.google.com/p/jo4neo/[old repository] is retired, please refer here to future questions.

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
   //used by jo4neo
   transient Nodeid node; 
   //simple property
   @neo String firstName;
   //helps you store a java.util.Date to neo4j 
   @neo Date date; 
   // jo4neo will index for you
   @neo(index=true) String email; 
   // many to many relation
   @neo Collection<Role> roles; 

   /* normal class oriented 
    * programming stuff goes here
    */
}
----

Annotating Java Object Properties
@neo String name;   Persist me to the graph as a property
@neo Person friend; Persist me to the graph as a node and relation
String misc;    Don't bother to persist me
@neo(index=true) String name;   Persist and index this field for me
@neo(fulltext=true) String content; Persist and full text index
@neo("HAS_JOB") Job job;    Persist using a given relation, by name
@embed Address address; Persist as serialized byte array
Locating Java Objects in the graph
If you ask jo4neo to index a property...

[source,java]
----
public class User {
 @neo(index=true) public String screenName;
...}
----

you may find it like this:

[source,java]
----
ObjectGraph graph = ...
User user = new User();
user = graph.find(user).where(user.screenName).is(screenName).result();
----

==== To find all nodes of a given type:
[source,java]
----
Collection<City> cities = graph.get(City.class);
----

==== To load a particular node as a java object:
[source,java]
----
Student s = graph.get(Student.class, 45);
----

==== To find the most recently added instances of a class:

[source,java]
----
// get the four latest roles added to the graph
Collection<Role> roles = graph.getMostRecent(Role.class, 4)
----
